<h2><i>WINNIE'S BATTLE WITH THE APARTHEID GOVERMENT</i></h2>
<P>Winnie Mandela emerged as a leading opponent of apartheid during the latter part of her husband's imprisonment. Due to her political activities, she was regularly detained by the National Party government. She was subjected to house arrest, kept under surveillance, imprisoned, and banished to the remote town of Brandfort.
   Her longest jail sentence was for 491 days,beginning on May 12, 1969, at Pretoria Central Prison, where she spent months in solitary confinement and was tortured and beaten by her own account, Winnie Mandela's experience in prison "hardened" her.

<p>From 1977 to 1985,she was banished to the town of Brandfort in the Orange Free State and confined to the area,except for when she was allowed to visit her husband at Robben Island.It was at this time that Winnie Mandela became well known in the Western world. She organised a creche with an NGO, Operation Hunger and a clinic in Brandfort with Dr Abu Baker Asvat, her personal physician,campaigned actively for equal rights and was promoted by the ANC as a symbol of their struggle against apartheid while in exile in Brandfort, she, and those who attempted to assist her, were harassed by the apartheid police.</p>
<h2><i>DARK SIDE OF WINNIE</i></h2>
<p>During a speech in Munsieville on 13 April 1986, Winnie Mandela endorsed the practice of necklacing (burning people alive using tyres and petrol) by saying "With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country.
   Further tarnishing her reputation were accusations by her bodyguard, Jerry Musivuzi Richardson, and others, at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, that she had ordered kidnapping and murder during the second half of the 1980s.</p>

Shortly after the conviction, she resigned from all leadership positions in the ANC, including her parliamentary seat and the presidency of the ANC Women's League.
   In July 2004 an appeal judge of the Pretoria High Court ruled that "the crimes were not committed for personal gain". The judge overturned the conviction for theft, but upheld the one for fraud, handing her a three years and six months suspended sentence</p>

   In the lead-up to Madikizela Mandela's funeral, in a politically fraught environment soon after the ouster of former president Jacob Zuma,Jessie Duarte, a senior ANC leader, warned critics to "sit down and shut up", with Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema saying that "anyone who accuses Mama Winnie of any crime is guilty of treason".
   Madikizela-Mandela was granted a Special Official Funeral by the South African government.Her public funeral service was held at Orlando Stadium on 14 April 2018.</p> 
   
<p>Planning for Madikizela Mandela's funeral was largely handled by her daughters and Julius Malema, and the ANC reportedly had to "fight for space" on the programme at the public service, ANC and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa acknowledged that the ANC failed to stand by Madikizela-Mandela's side during her legal troubles.Julius Malema,delivered an impassioned speech in which he criticised the United Democratic Front for distancing themselves from Madikizela-Mandela in the 1980s.Malema also criticised members of the National Executive Committee of the ANC Women's League for resigning in 1995,because they regarded Madikizela-Mandela as a "criminal".Madikizela-Mandela's daughter Zenani attacked those who "vilified" her mother, calling them hypocrites.
